## Description

This is a basic web application created to showcase my understanding of building basic web applications with C# MVCs and showcases my grasp on stroring objects within objects. This application allows the user to track orders by adding vendors, and adding detailed orders to the vendors. The user can also delete all vendors and orders, or individual vendors and orders. This application was created with the guidance of **EPICODUS**, the greatest coding bootcamp in the known universe, and google.
